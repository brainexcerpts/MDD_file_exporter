# MDD file format exporter / importer
MDD (**M**otion **D**esigner **D**ocument) sometimes refered as **P**oint **C**ache **E**xport, is a file format that allows to save an animated mesh as a sequence of vertex coordinates for each frame. The file basically stores a snapshot of every mesh vertices for each frame which you can easily replay in softwares like Blender, Maya etc.
